# Foundations-Capston

My goal for this project is to allow the user to keep track of recipes in one place and give the user the option to add ingredients from those recipes to a shopping list.

## Main Features
* Users can get a list of their favorite recipes.
* Users can add entries to their favorite recipes.
* Users can update entries from their favorite recipes.
* Users can delete entries from their favorite recipes.

## MakeUp
The initial page will display two buttons titled, Recipes, and Add Recipe, as well as a form. The recipes button will load saved recipes from a postgres database. The add recipes button will allow the user to add new recipes with a form field. Once added, each recipe entry will have two additional buttons, an edit and Delete button, which will allow the users to delete or make changes to the saved recipes from the database. When new entities are added the user will get an alert notifying them it has been added successfully or that theyâ€™ll need to complete the required fields in the form before the entry can be added.
